# Demos for Move.elm

There are three projects for demostrating `Move.elm` capabilities:

-   `Single.elm` for reordering a list
-   `Multiple.elm` for moving items between list. The list can have different types.
-   `Table.elm` for moving items between list like in the XB table.

If you want to switch between these demos you need to correct the `index.html` file near the Elm code injection (sorry).

## node commands

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm run s  # with corrected index.html
$ npm run m  # with corrected index.html
```
