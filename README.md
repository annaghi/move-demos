# Demos for Move.elm

There are three projects for demonstrating `Move.elm` capabilities:

-   `Single.elm` for reordering a list
-   `Multiple.elm` for moving items between lists. The lists can have different types.
-   `Table.elm` for moving items between lists like in the XB table.

### Commands

```bash
$ npm install

$ npm run s
$ npm run m
$ npm run t
```

_Unfortunately, `elm-live` supports only `elm` files for watching, so you need to manually refresh the browser on each `scss` update._

_On the bright side there is a PR already:_ [_https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live/pull/227_](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live/pull/227)
